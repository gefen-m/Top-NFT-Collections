# Top NFT Collections
Hello! 

In the following report I aim to give an outline of the recent data on Top NFT Collections fetched from the <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com" target="_top">CoinMarketCap</a>. 

# Introduction
NFT (Non Fungible Tokens) are units of data, which represent unique digital or non-digital assets along with their ownership. The items may be music, collectibles, videos, digital-diplomas, digital clothes and many more.  

It is principal that NFTs are unique and are stored on blockchains, which ensures their ownership at any particular moment and preserves the history of prior posession. Moreover NFTs may act as tickets allowing the holders to obtain goods or priveleges associated with the token and become members of the community. Eventually whole ecosystems emerge around NFTs and the most notable applications of NFT are soon-to-be. 

The dataset examined here is comprised of top NFT collections by sales volume. I extracted the data from the site on 28th of March 2022. The whole data is divided into the two batches: all-time data and 30-days data. In each batch the items fit into one of the three categories based on the blockchain platform: Etherium (ETH), Solana (SOL) or Binance (BUSD). The name in brackets is the respective crypto token (altcoin) or native cryptocurrency. 

The main idea here is to see how the tendencies have altered through the past month. We are not going to go overly deep, rather get some insights about the situation. 

So let us begin!
