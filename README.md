# Top NFT Collections
Hello! Here I perform an initial analysis of a Kaggle dataset Top NFT Collections available via https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nenamalikah/nft-collections-by-sales-volume

# Introduction
NFT (Non Fungible Tokens) are units of data, which represent unique digital or non-digital assets along with their ownership. The items may be music, collectibles, videos, digital-diplomas, digital clothes and many more.

It is principal that NFTs are unique and are stored on blockchains, which ensures their ownership at any particular moment and preserves the history of prior posession. Moreover NFTs may act as tickets allowing the holders to obtain goods or priveleges associated with the token and become members of the community. Eventually whole ecosystems emerge around NFTs and the most notable applications of NFT are soon-to-be.

The dataset examined here is comprised of top NFT collections by sales volume. The data was pulled on January 16, 2022 and contains all time information for the top collections (since 2014). Note: items on the NFT market are organized in collections which fit to some category in accord with shared features.

# Analysis plan
In my analysis I employed the following plan:
1. Looked at the data and made intuitive predictions about the variables relation.
2. Got rid of the junk or unnecessary values.
3. Checked my assumtions. 
4. Formatted the data.
5. Performed model fitting and plotted the results.
